# Disasembler
Disasembler written with Asembly.
Works on DOSBox 0.74 as vell as on Emu 8086.
Can disassemle almost all Assembly 8086 commands except FPU ones.
Have to be launched with 2 parameters separated by space symbol. First parameter - name of data file, second - name of results file.
I'm adding some files for testing and expected results.
